            <div class = "hobbies"><H2> My Hobbies </H2>
     In my free time I like to go to dance classes, particularly street and hip-hop.
     When I am not working or studying, I also like to read. Currently, I'm reading a book called the Sapiens.

      As a child, I learnt how to play piano and a little bit on guitar. I enjoyed playing classical pieces however in my free time I like listening to R&B/afrobeats.
     My Favourite artists are:
        <ol>
        <li> Burna Boy</li>
        <li> Chris Brown </li>
        <li> Rihanna </li>
